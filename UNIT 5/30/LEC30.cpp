Answer here
|h(TL) +h(TR)| = 1


|h(TR)| = 1


|h(TL)| = 1


|h(TL) – h(TR)| <= 1//

A node with a balance factor of 2 can be deleted by performing a single rotation.

True


//False

In the AVL tree, which operation is NOT used during the deletion process?

Rotation


Insertion


wrong-answer
Traversal//


wrong-answer
Balancing


In an AVL tree, when is rotation required during the deletion operation?

Always


When the tree is empty


//When the balance factor of the node being deleted is -1 or +1 or 0


wrong-answer
Only for nodes with one child


What is the time complexity of AVL tree deletion?



Note: This kind of question is asked in the HCL requirement.

O(log n)//


wrong-answer
O(n)


O(n log n)


It depends on the case and tree structure

When deleting a node from an AVL tree, what is the maximum number of rotations required to restore balance, counting LR and RL rotations as a single rotation?
